# GC9A01 driver for LVGL micropython bindings on the ESP32
A driver for displays using the GC901 driver for use with LVGL micropython

This driver is heavily based on the existing LVGL ILI9341 driver and developped for personal use, although it may be of use to others

An example of a display using this is waveshares round 240x240 IPS LCD: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.28inch_LCD_Module
